        <h2>Our Founder is the Heart and Soul of Sumbea</h2>
        <p>Jared Stephens is the founder of Sumbea and his journey is the perfect example of what radiation can do to your body and how to heal from it.</p>
        <p>Over the past 10 years, Jared has visited almost 80 different holistic centers in over 15 countries. He has spent the last 2 years on a search for the most Radiation safe environments in over 60 different accommodations all over the world.</p>
        <p>He is an artist, a writer, and an entrepreneur that has developed over 10 retreats, 4 technology platforms, and consulted with over 80 different organizations. One of his leading values is simply to have more fun and enjoy what life currently offers, even if in a toxic environment.</p>
        <p>He is the heart and soul of Sumbea, dedicating his life to creating harmonious living for all beings.</p>
        <p>After traveling the world, Jared began to realize that being in Nature was the most important element to his own healing and that natural frequencies were the key to living a harmonious way of live.</p> 
        <p>Within every environment, all the natural elements play some kind of role in the search for connection. Working with the elements to help create a sense of balance is needed in today’s toxic world. Every environment calls for a different approach.</p> 
        <p>Whether it be adding more stone to a structure or introducing a water feature. All of these ideas can lead to an environment of love. One in which we are working together in an environment, rather than against.</p>
        <p>Collaboration is key in the development of balanced and harmonious living environment. Together we can create greater impact, more connection, and simply… a little bit more fun :)</p>

        <h2>Barriers to Harmonious Living</h2>
        <p>There are many barriers to harmonious living, but a major barrier is Radiation.</p>
        <p>Radiation can come in the forms of wireless communication devices, our vehicles, and even the electrical wires hanging over our heads.</p>
        <p>It is a man-made frequency that can affect the body in a negative way. Learning how to prevent radiation exposure and sickness is of utmost importance in this day and age.</p>
        <Callout buttonText="PDF" color="red">Learn more about Radiation in our FREE Radiation PDF here.</Callout>
        <p>Radiation can causes serious health issues such as dizziness, insomnia, fatigue, headaches, confused intuition, and strong electrical sensations throughout the body.</p>
        <p>These symptoms of Radiation poisoning can collectively wreak havoc on the body, compromising overall health and well-being.</p>
        <p>Dizziness disrupts equilibrium, increasing the risk of accidents and impacting cognitive functions. Insomnia, characterized by sleeplessness, disrupts the body's natural restorative processes, leading to impaired concentration, memory, and mood disturbances. Fatigue saps energy reserves, making even simple tasks arduous and contributing to chronic stress. Headaches, often a result of stress or sleep deprivation, trigger pain and discomfort, hindering productivity and quality of life. Confused intuition leaves one uncertain and prone to poor decisions, while strong electrical sensations coursing through the body can be unsettling, causing anxiety and discomfort.</p>
        <p>The cumulative effect of these symptoms can lead to a vicious cycle of declining health, underlining the importance of seeking timely medical attention and practicing self-care for a balanced and healthy life.</p>
